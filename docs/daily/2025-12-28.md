# Development Log: 2025-12-28

Based on recent activity and git commits, here is a detailed summary of the features and improvements implemented in the last 24 hours.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Sidebar & Interface Refinement
*   **Smooth Sidebar Lifecycle**: Implemented a sequenced transition for the sidebar collapse. The "System Status" card now fades out its opacity *before* collapsing its height/margin, eliminating visual flickering.
*   **Tools Workflow Integrated**: 
    *   Added a new "Tools" entry in the main sidebar.
    *   Implemented a dedicated **Tools Sidebar** (similar to Settings) to house maintenance features.
    *   Moved "Fix Locations", "Update Metadata", and "Fix Date Time" into this cleaner, focused workflow.
*   **System Status Card**: Consolidated storage and processing statistics into a single, compact "System" card with a live progress bar and usage metrics.

### 2. Media Processing & Job System
*   **Media Pipeline v2**: Implementation of a comprehensive media processing pipeline, including scanning, hashing, and metadata extraction.
*   **Cascading Job Restarts**: Implemented logic to intelligently restart dependent jobs. For example, clearing a scan job now correctly resets and re-queues downstream processing tasks.
*   **Live Statistics**: Integrated a \`useStats\` hook and backend \`liveStatsService\` to provide real-time updates on photo counts, video counts, and disk usage within the UI.
*   **Concurrency Controls**: Added global settings to control job concurrency, allowing users to tune performance based on their hardware.

### 3. Settings & API Architecture
*   **API Centralization**: Refactored the frontend API layer, moving endpoint definitions to a modular \`endpoints/\` structure to improve maintainability.
*   **Video Processing Settings**: New dedicated settings page for video encoding, quality presets, and thumbnail generation.
*   **Image Optimization**: Refined sliders for image quality and thumbnail generation parameters.
*   **Unified UI Styling**: Standardized the settings layout across all categories (Thumbnails, Raw, Encoding, etc.) for a consistent user experience.

### 4. New Pages & UI Components
*   **Files Explorer**: Introduced a new "Files" view to browse internal library structures.
*   **Sources Redesign**: Completely overhauled the "Sources" management page with a modernized card layout and clearer status indicators.
*   **Custom Modal System**: Implemented a reusable, premium Modal component with smooth entry/exit animations for search filtering and source additions.

### 5. Backend & Maintenance
*   **Modular Settings Service**: Transferred settings logic into a typed, singleton service on the backend to ensure consistency between the filesystem and the DB.
*   **Log Management**: Improved backend logging and simplified local development by untracking machine-specific \`.env\` and log files.
*   **Environment Sync**: Ensured strict TypeScript typing alignment between frontend models and backend DTOs.
